# weather-dashboard-assignment

For this assignment we were tasked with creating a weather dashboard that displays the current weather for the chosen city
  based on the user's input. The dashboard will display the current temperature, humidity, high and low temperatures,
  wind speed, and UV index- all from the third party API openweathermap.org. 
When the name of a city is entered the selection will populate below the search box for future use.
